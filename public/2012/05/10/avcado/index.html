      <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Shortly after getting into web development, I made a number of websites for some clients. Once their site was built, I would set up their domain under their own account at a registrar, and I’d push their site onto a cheap, shared host, also under their own account. I thought this was great! I could focus on other things without having to worry about managing their websites, and my clients weren’t paying much to keep their site up and running.</p>
<p>It turns out this wasn’t the greatest set up after all. When I needed to make a change on one of their sites, it was a huge headache trying to push an update when the server constantly timed out, or better yet, threw me a 500 error while I couldn’t do anything about it. But I guess you get what you pay for.</p>
<p>To make things easier for both myself and my clients, I decided to build <a href="https://avcado.com" target="_blank">avcado</a>. The goal in building this is to abstract all of the technical details of running a website, from domain registration to hosting, for a minimal fee (just enough to cover my expenses). The benefit to me is that I have full control of my server, and hence the ability to make updates quickly and easily. <em>Avcado</em> is the web portal for my clients to view their site’s analytics, as well as manage their billing information.</p>
<h2 id="Metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>Everyone loves graphs, it’s a fact. Clients want to see how their website’s performing, and they want to view this data easily. I recently discovered <a href="http://gaug.es" target="_blank">Gauges</a> (now acquired by GitHub) and absolutely love their service, so I decided to plug into their API and bring their wonderful analytics data to my clients through <em>avcado</em>.</p>
<p>I create a new Gauge and and add it to each website I make. A step-by-step process walks through creating a new client account on <em>avcado</em>. During this process I can add a new domain or choose an existing one, automatically create a new Gauges API key, and then choose the corresponding Gauge to connect the website to. Just like that, my client has access to the following metrics from Gauges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Referrers</li>
<li>Search Terms</li>
<li>Search Engines</li>
<li>Locations</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the data is read well enough in tabular or list form. But there are a couple metrics that can be enhanced with a chart or graph, such as the Traffic and the Search Engines metrics. Using <a href="http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/" target="_blank">Rickshaw</a>, a graphing toolkit by Shutterstock built on  <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/" target="_blank">d3</a>, I can create a nifty interactive chart for traffic analytics to show the number of people and views for each day in the current month. As for the Search Engines metric, I use <a href="http://www.rgraph.net/" target="_blank">RGraph</a>, an HTML5 Canvas based graphing toolkit, to generate a little donut chart of the search engines split.</p>
<p>A map for the Locations metric would be super useful. I’m working on that.</p>
<h2 id="Billing">Billing</h2>
<p>Payments, subscriptions, and invoicing has been made incredibly easy thanks to <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>. Using their awesome API, I can even create new subscriptions, coupons, and invoices right from the <em>avcado</em> admin section. Aside from making payments simple, my clients’ payment information is also secured, since I don’t need to worry about storing it on my own servers.</p>
