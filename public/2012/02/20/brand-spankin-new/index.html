<p>Page, that is. This must be the third redesign of my website in the past year. You heard right, THIRD. “But this is the one,” I always say. False. I keep scrapping and rebuilding this darn site. It’s not that I thought the old versions were bad, they just could be better. Hence, this latest redesign: stronger, better, faster.</p>
<h2 id="Is_that_a_blog_I_see?">Is that a blog I see?</h2>
<p>Yes, it is, thanks for noticing!</p>
<p>Aside from my insatiable appetite for changing my home page, the main purpose of this latest iteration was to launch not just a splash page but also a blog. I’ve been wanting to blog about more than memes and cat gifs (I less than three you, Tumblr), specifically about my latest findings, projects, hacks, and other snippets I feel like sharing. Not only do I push content out into the Web, I also benefit by gaining a better understanding of what I write about, more practice expressing ideas clearly and concisely, and a neat log of milestones in my development career.</p>
<h2 id="Dr-_Jekyll">Dr. Jekyll</h2>
<p>I had a tough time choosing which blogging platform to host this site on. It eventually boiled down to Tumblr and Jekyll. The appeal of Tumblr came from the fact that I was already always on it, which I felt would have motivated me to blog more. It also has a pretty simple editing and publishing platform, not to mention easy theme rolling.</p>
<p>I started developing the new site on Tumblr for some time, then stumbled across Jekyll. After some contemplating, Jekyll seemed to be the better solution for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I get to own, manage, and completely customize my posts, data, etc.</li>
<li>Jekyll builds static pages, which I can serve up really quickly.</li>
<li>Markdown is awesomely simple!</li>
<li>I can roll my own publishing and deployment methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point has turned out to be the coolest. Working at Linode for the past few months, I’ve grown to love the command line. A <em>lot</em>. It’s oddly exhilarating to be able to draft a new page with a <code>rake new:post</code> and publish it with a simple <code>rake publish &amp;&amp; rsync</code>.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to writing more and building out this site’s content (as it’s pretty empty right now). As for the design, I think it’s here to stay, at least for a little while. I can’t promise I won’t be making a few tweaks here and there.</p>
<p>P.S. You can view the source on <a href="http://github.com/jico/baligod.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>! Feel free to do what you want with it. I’d appreciate if you didn’t copy it <em>exactly</em> though.</p>
