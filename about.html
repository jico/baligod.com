        <p>Hi, my name is Jico. I'm a full-time CS student and part-time Linode support staffer hailing from the cozy, little island of Brigantine, NJ. The Richard Stockton college of NJ is where I'll soon be graduating from, majoring in Computer Science and a minor (possibly another major) in Mathematics.</p>
        <p>I love writing code, learning new things, and hacking away at projects. You can say I'm a web developer, but no one likes labels. I'm a lover of all things technology-y: from programming (more recently in Ruby) to anything Linux (which is a must, as a fellow Linodian).</p>
