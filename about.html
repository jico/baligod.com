        <h2>Jico Baligod</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Jico. I'm a full-time CS student and part-time Linode support staffer hailing from the cozy, little island of Brigantine, NJ. I'm currently enrolled in the Richard Stockton College of NJ, graduating soon with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor (or possibly another B.S.) in Mathematics.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for writing code, creative ideas, and learning new things. You could say I'm more of a web developer, but who likes labels? I'm a lover of all things technology.</p>
        <h2>The blog</h2>
        <p>Dig the website? It's built on <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and powered by <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a>. You can check out the source on <a href="http://github.com/jico/baligod.com">GitHub</a>. Feel free to fork it, use it as a template, whatever. Just do me a favor and change it up a little ;)</p>
