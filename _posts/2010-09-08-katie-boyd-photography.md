Katie Boyd is a Fine Arts student and photographer based in South Jersey. She primarily shoots conceptual images, but is keen on snapping portraits and even her self-made paper sculptures from time to time.

## First!

After taking my first programming class and being exposed to the wonders of code at the start of 2010, I decided to dive head first into web design and web development over the summer. I find learning by doing is the best approach to understanding things, so I needed a project to work on. Luckily, my girlfriend wanted a web portfolio and was kind enough to let me develop one for her absolutely free of charge!

After pouring over Internet references, tutorials, and a couple books, I cooked up my first ever website and launched it on a super cheap shared web host. The site was crafted using [valid](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fkatieboydphotography.com%2F) XHTML 1.0 Strict, a little CSS3, and jQuery for some subtle cloud-moving action, as well as the gallery (using the awesome [Galleria](http://galleria.io/) plugin).
