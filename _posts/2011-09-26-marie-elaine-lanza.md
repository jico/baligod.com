Marie Elaine Lanza is a ceramics artist based in Cape May Courthouse. She designs and produces functional earthenware pottery out of her home studio and showroom. Her work is an exemplified display of brilliant colors, aquatic visuals, and calligrophic strokes of paint.

Her website is an embodiment of her work, from the contemporary style to contrasting palette and typefaces. A touch of javascript adds some dynamic elements to the pages and a slight modern feel. The website also acts as her online storefront, offering the pieces featured for sale either through PayPal or a custom request form. A custom backend administrative system also gives her nearly complete access to modify and update copy, gallery items, and other bits.
