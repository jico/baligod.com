Jacqueline Boyd is a fine artist based in Brigantine, NJ, who works prominently with oil and acrylic to create pieces of painterly realism to abstraction. She recently opened her own studio in Brigantine, which is one of a kind in South Jersey. The Jacqueline Boyd Fine Art Studio functions as her working studio, as well as a venue for art shows, classes, and other events.

The website serves as both a gallery for her work and her studio page. It features a full back-end administration system that allows her to add/update classes, events, and exhibitions, as well as modify pieces of text including studio info, bio, and others.
