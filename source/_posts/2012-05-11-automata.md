## The Gem

As a final project for my Theory of Computation class, I worked with [Lukas Sabota](http://xannode.com/) in writing this fine Gem for creating a number of types of [automata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory), including:

* Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
* Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
* Push-down Automata (PDA)
* Turing Machines

These automata are formally defined by _n_-tuples, and as such we can build them by defining their corresponding instance fields in one of two ways: individually through setter methods, or through a structured YAML file. Once we've built our automaton, we're then able to feed it input and evaluate the output.

There's a ton of documentation available at the following:

* [The GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/jico/automata/wiki)
* [RubyDoc](http://rubydoc.info/gems/automata)

## But wait! There's more!

To make our Gem and its features more accessible to non-Rubyists, non-programmers, and other students, I spun up a little web interface for it at [automata.byji.co](http://automata.byji.co). You're able to build an automaton by defining its features via YAML structure. Once you've built your machine, you can then feed it input and evaluate its output.
