fflocks is a web service that pulls the latest images from the public Twitter timeline into a photostream. It queries Twitter's Search API for tweets containing links to Twitpic, yFrog, Plixi/Lockerz or Twitgoo, then uses the appropriate service's photo API to deliver the source image. Tweets on fflocks only go as far back as 48 hours.

Aside from the photostream users can search through recent images, and view the album of any public profile. To view someone's fflocks album, simply go to fflocks.com/username. Photo albums sift through the user's tweets for any supported image links, and loads each photo and tweet into their album.

fflocks spawned from a 4-hour hack and was built with PHP, jQuery, and of course, the Twitter API!

## Oh no!

The site's not in service at the moment (how sad..). I might be sticking it in a project archives page sometime soon.
